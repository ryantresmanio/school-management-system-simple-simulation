# School Management System

This is a simple console-based **School Management System** built in Java.  
The project was created to **practice and demonstrate my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as:

- Classes and Objects  
- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance  
- Exception Handling  
- Basic List management and Input Validation  

### Features
- Add new students with details like name, age, ID, grade level, and section.
  > A **password** (literally "password") is required to access this feature, since it doesn't make sense to allow anyone to add students freely.
- View all students and search by student number.
- View all available subjects (courses).
- Enroll a student to a course.
- View enrolled students per course.
- View all sections and students per section.
